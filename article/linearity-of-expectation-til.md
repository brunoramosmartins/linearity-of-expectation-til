# The Most Useful Theorem in Probability Has No Independence Hypothesis

> **What this is.** The one everyday result in probability that needs no independence hypothesis — and why that makes the mean of a budget trustworthy while its risk band stays fragile. You should be comfortable with expectation, variance, and correlation. By the end you will know which half of a forecast survives correlated inputs, and which half does not. Figure and numbers reproduce from the [companion repository](https://github.com/brunoramosmartins/linearity-of-expectation-til).

Most budget forecasts fail for the wrong reason: the expected total is right, the uncertainty around it is not. The cause is one of the cleanest results in probability — used every day under a hypothesis it does not need. Independence shows up by page 30 of every textbook and never leaves: the CLT needs it, the Law of Large Numbers needs it, the variance of a sum needs it. Exactly one everyday result breaks the pattern.

**Linearity of expectation** says: for any random variables $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ on a common probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ with finite expectation,

$$
E\left[\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\right] = \sum_{i=1}^n E[X_i].
$$

No independence. No common distribution. No constraint on the joint law beyond integrability.

Expectation is the Lebesgue integral $E[X] = \int_\Omega X \, dP$ — a continuous linear functional on $L^1(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$. Linearity of expectation is the linearity of that functional. The joint law never enters the integral of a sum. By contrast, $E[XY] = E[X] \cdot E[Y]$ requires the joint to factor; multiplication is not linear. Correlation does not affect the first moment; it enters only at second order.

## A 50-person team

Each monthly salary $S_i$ is LogNormal (strictly positive, right-skewed) with $E[S_i] = \text{R\$ }10{,}000$ and CV 20%. Compensation bands induce latent-factor dependence — market adjustments and headcount reshuffles move salaries together — so a pairwise correlation $\rho \approx 0.2$ is a defensible central estimate.

**First moment.** Linearity gives the total immediately:

$$
E\left[\sum_{i=1}^{50} S_i\right] = 50 \cdot 10{,}000 = \text{R\$ }500{,}000.
$$

The correlation does not appear.

**Second-order structure.** The variance of the sum is a quadratic form. With $\Sigma$ the $50 \times 50$ covariance matrix,

$$
\text{Var}(\mathbf{1}^\top \mathbf{S}) = \mathbf{1}^\top \Sigma \mathbf{1} = \sum_{i, j} \Sigma_{ij}.
$$

Every off-diagonal entry contributes. Under equicorrelation this collapses to $50 \sigma^2 (1 + 49\rho)$ — at $\rho = 0.2$, about $10.8\times$ the independent variance, and a 95% band $\sim 3.3\times$ wider.

![Correlation sweep with the same marginals: the mean total stays flat (left) while the variance and the 95% half-width rise by more than an order of magnitude (middle, right) as the equicorrelation grows from -0.02 to 0.9 — first-moment invariance and second-order explosion on the same axis.](../figures/correlation_sweep.png)

## Takeaway

Two rules to keep separate:

- **First moment of a sum:** ignore correlation. Marginals fix the answer.
- **Variance, 95% band, tail risk:** correlation is the whole game.

The failure mode I see most often is treating the second with tools that worked for the first. Result: budgets whose central estimates are right and whose risk bands are off by a factor of three. The quarter when everything correlates at once is the quarter that destroys the margin of safety.
